  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>This website exists to document the vaiours programming projects I have created, and the programming skills that I have been developing. I started programming at university with Haskell, followed by Java, but I took a long hiatus before returning to programming in the last few years. I majored in Mathematics at for my undergrad, and I have a Master of Teaching. Initially doing this as a hobby, I started out working with C, and now I have worked to expand my skillset into Javascript/HTML/CSS, and I am also working to develop my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.</p>
