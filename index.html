	  <h3>About this site:</h3>
	  <p>This website exists to document the various programming projects I have created, and the programming skills that I have been developing. I started programming at university with Haskell, followed by Java, but I took a long hiatus before returning to programming in the last few years. I majored in Mathematics for my undergrad, and I have a Master of Teaching. Initially doing this as a hobby, I started out working with C, and now I have worked to expand my skillset into Javascript/HTML/CSS, SQL, C++ and Python, and I am also working to develop my knowledge of networks, data structures and algorithms.</p>

      <div class="proj-desc kenken" hidden>
  		  <p>This project started as an excuse to implement linked lists, but grew from there into a full fledged Kenken generator, solver and game. Throughout this project, I had to develop my C skills extensively, in particular building my knowledge of memory allocation, C data types and recursive algorithms. This project also required me to develop skills in organising and planning software as I went.
				</p>
        <p>
				  I then created a program "GUI-Kenken" which required me to learn SDL2, a common graphics library with windowing and rendering capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
				  This project is still a work in progress, and I am working towards adding saving and loading games, a start menu, and eventually, a rewrite of several core components allow a variably sized Kenken.

  		<div class="proj-desc website" hidden>
        <p>A simple website to showcase the development of my software development knowledge. This currently contains simple HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
        <p>Source code for the website can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/w-flowers/w-flowers.github.io">https://github.com/w-flowers/w-flowers.github.io</a></p>

      <div class="proj-desc algos" hidden>
  		  <p>I have been working through the algorithms in this textbook, and implementing them in C. I am currently up to Sorting Algorithms, and though I have seen these before at uni, it is a good recap.
        </p>

          The git repository linked contains some of my solutions to the exercises of this book. <a href="https://github.com/w-flowers/algos_in_c">https://github.com/w-flowers/algos_in_c</a></p>

      <h4 class="proj-heading dateconvert" hidden><a href="https://github.com/w-flowers/py-code">Date Converter</a></h4>
      <div class="proj-desc dateconvert" hidden>
        <p>A simple command line Python program that converts a date from one format to another. An exercise to practice using the basic control flow constructs and standard library tools available in Python.</p>
        <p>
          The git repository linked contains the source code of this program in the directory "dateconverter". <a href="https://github.com/w-flowers/py-code">https://github.com/w-flowers/py-code</a></p>

      <h4 class="proj-heading scoredb" hidden><a href="https://github.com/w-flowers/py-code">Score Database</a></h4>
      <div class="proj-desc scoredb" hidden>
        <p>A library for entering a username, score and time taken into a sqlite3 database file. Currently contains functions for writing scores to the database, and returning a list of scores, either ordered by time entered or by score. I am planning to extend the scoredb library to allow fetching by username, and fetching by date range.</p>
        <p>
          The git repository linked contains the source code of this program in the directory "scoredb". <a href="https://github.com/w-flowers/py-code">https://github.com/w-flowers/py-code</a></p>
