	  <h3>About this site:</h3>
	  <p>This website exists to document the various programming projects I have created, and the programming skills that I have been developing. I started programming at university with Haskell, followed by Java, but I took a long hiatus before returning to programming in the last few years. I majored in Mathematics for my undergrad, and I have a Master of Teaching. Initially doing this as a hobby, I started out working with C, and now I have worked to expand my skillset into Javascript/HTML/CSS, and I am also working to develop my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.</p>

  		<p class="proj-desc kenken" hidden>This project started as an excuse to implement linked lists, but grew from there into a full fledged Kenken generator, solver and game. Throughout this project, I had to develop my C skills extensively, in particular building my knowledge of memory allocation, C data types and recursive algorithms. I also created a program "GUI-Kenken" which required me to learn SDL2, a common graphics library with windowing and rendering capabilities.</p>
 		 <h4 class="proj-heading website" hidden><a href="https://github.com/w-flowers/w-flowers.github.io">Website</a></h4>
  		<p class="proj-desc website" hidden>A simple website to showcase the development of my software development knowledge. This currently contains only simple HTML, but will be modified in the future to add some Javascript and CSS.</p>
  		<h4 class="proj-heading algos" hidden>Algorithms in C</h4>
  		<p class="proj-desc algos" hidden>I have been working through the algorithms in this textbook, and implementing them in C. I am currently up to Trees, and though I have seen these before at uni, it is a good recap.</p>
