  <h3>About this site:</h3>
  <p>This website exists to document the various programming projects I have created, and the programming skills that I have been developing. I started programming at university with Haskell, followed by Java, but I took a long hiatus before returning to programming in the last few years. I majored in Mathematics for my undergrad, and I have a Master of Teaching. Initially doing this as a hobby, I started out working with C, and now I have worked to expand my skillset into Javascript/HTML/CSS, and I am also working to develop my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.</p>

  <h2>Current Projects</h2>
  <h4><a href="https://github.com/w-flowers/Kenken">Kenken</a></h4>
  <p>This project started as an excuse to implement linked lists, but grew from there into a full fledged Kenken generator, solver and game. Throughout this project, I had to develop my C skills extensively, in particular building my knowledge of memory allocation, C data types and recursive algorithms. I also created a program "GUI-Kenken" which required me to learn SDL2, a common graphics library with windowing and rendering capabilities.</p>
