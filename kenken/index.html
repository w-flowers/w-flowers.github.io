            </h3>
            <p>
            This project started as an excuse to implement linked lists,
            but grew from there into a full fledged Mathdoku (a.k.a. Kenken) 
            generator, solver and game. Throughout this project, I had to
            develop my C skills extensively, in particular building my 
            knowledge of memory allocation, C data types and recursive
            algorithms. This project also required me to develop skills in
            organising and planning software as I went.
            </p>
            <p>
            I then created a program "GUI-Kenken" which required me to learn 
            SDL2, a common graphics library with windowing and rendering 
            capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have now completed this project, having added loading and 
            saving features and a start menu. One day I may do a more major 
            rewrite to allow for variably sized puzzles to be created and 
            stored, but that is not something that I plan to implement in 
            the near future.

            I have been working through the algorithms in this textbook, 
            and implementing them in C. I have finished Sorting Algorithms, 
            and am starting to work through the sections on searching 
            algorithms.

            A library for entering a username, score and time taken into a

            scores to the database, and returning a list of scores, either 
            ordered by time entered or by score. I am planning to extend the 
            scoredb library to allow fetching by username, and fetching by 
            date range.
